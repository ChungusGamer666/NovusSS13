On this PR (https://github.com/Skyrat-SS13/Skyrat-tg/pull/8960) skyrat made my life a living hell 
and I had to write this fucking stupid tool to join their sprites together.
However, this tool got expanded to be a general tool for boring Novus development tasks,
that are better done with some kind of automation.
